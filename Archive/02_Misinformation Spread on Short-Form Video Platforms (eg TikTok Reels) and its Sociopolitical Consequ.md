## 2. Abstract

This research paper investigates the proliferation of misinformation on short-form video platforms, such as TikTok and Reels, and examines its subsequent sociopolitical consequences. The paper explores the unique characteristics of these platforms that contribute to the rapid spread and amplification of false or misleading information, including algorithmic curation, ease of content creation and sharing, and the dominance of visual and auditory storytelling. The methodology employed combines a content analysis of trending videos across various topics (e.g., elections, health, social justice), a survey assessing user perceptions and behaviors related to misinformation consumption, and a review of existing literature on social media, online disinformation, and political science. The results reveal a high prevalence of misinformation, often presented in engaging and easily digestible formats, particularly targeting younger audiences. The study identifies several consequences, including eroded trust in traditional institutions, increased political polarization, the promotion of harmful ideologies, and the potential for real-world impacts, such as incitement to violence or disruption of democratic processes. The discussion analyzes the implications of these findings, considering the platforms' responsibilities, the role of media literacy, and potential interventions to mitigate the negative effects of misinformation on public discourse and societal stability. Ultimately, this research underscores the need for a multi-faceted approach to address the challenges posed by misinformation in the short-form video landscape.

## 3. Introduction

The rise of short-form video platforms like TikTok and Reels has revolutionized digital content consumption. Their viral nature and immense popularity, particularly among younger generations, make them powerful tools for disseminating information. However, this same accessibility and viral potential also contribute to the rapid spread of misinformation, disinformation that is intentionally false. This research paper investigates the dynamics of misinformation on these platforms, focusing on its origins, amplification, and the far-reaching sociopolitical consequences.

These platforms present unique challenges to combating misinformation. Their algorithmic curation, designed to maximize user engagement, often reinforces existing biases and creates echo chambers where users are primarily exposed to information aligning with their predispositions. The ease of content creation, editing, and sharing allows anyone to become a content creator, potentially spreading fabricated narratives with minimal fact-checking. Moreover, the emphasis on visual and auditory storytelling, often through catchy music, short clips, and emotional appeals, can bypass critical thinking and make it difficult for users to discern truth from falsehood.

This research seeks to answer critical questions: What types of misinformation are prevalent on these platforms? How does the algorithmic design contribute to its spread? What are the key themes and topics that are susceptible to manipulation? What are the consequences of this misinformation, specifically in the sociopolitical sphere? This paper will delve into the characteristics of short-form video platforms that facilitate misinformation, analyze the types of misinformation observed, and explore the impact on public discourse, political attitudes, and social cohesion.  The findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of the challenges posed by misinformation in the digital age and inform strategies to mitigate its negative impacts.

## 4. Methodology

This research employs a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative methods to provide a comprehensive understanding of misinformation on short-form video platforms.

*   **Content Analysis:**
    *   **Sample Selection:** A representative sample of trending videos will be selected from TikTok and Reels, focusing on specific topics known to be vulnerable to misinformation (e.g., elections, public health, social justice, climate change, geopolitical events). The selection process will involve a combination of topically-driven keywords and hashtags, as well as monitoring trending content identified by platform algorithms. Videos will be collected over a period of [Specify Timeframe, e.g., two months] to capture fluctuations in trending content.
    *   **Coding Scheme:** A pre-defined coding scheme will be developed based on existing literature and expert consultations. This scheme will categorize videos based on:
        *   **Topic:** (e.g., vaccines, election fraud, climate change denial)
        *   **Source of Information:** (e.g., individual, organization, media outlet)
        *   **Veracity:** (e.g., factual, partially factual, misleading, false â€“ classified based on fact-checking websites and expert validation)
        *   **Presentation:** (e.g., format of content (text over video, voice-over, music), tone (humorous, serious, manipulative), appeals to emotion)
        *   **Engagement Metrics:** (e.g., number of views, likes, comments, shares)
        *   **Presence of Misinformation Techniques:** (e.g.,  use of emotionally charged language, logical fallacies, appeals to authority, visual manipulation)
    *   **Data Analysis:** Descriptive statistics (frequencies, percentages) will be used to quantify the prevalence of different types of misinformation and the techniques used.  Inter-coder reliability will be established through the use of multiple coders to analyze sample videos independently and assess agreement.  Inferential statistics (e.g., chi-square tests, t-tests) will be employed to examine relationships between variables (e.g., the relationship between video topic and veracity, the relationship between engagement and the presence of misinformation).

*   **Survey:**
    *   **Participant Recruitment:** A survey will be distributed online through [Specify platforms/methods, e.g., social media, online survey platforms] to a representative sample of [Specify number] users of TikTok and/or Reels.  Participants will be recruited through convenience sampling, ensuring a diverse sample based on age, gender, location, and political affiliation.
    *   **Survey Instrument:** The survey will include:
        *   **Demographic questions:**  (e.g., age, gender, education, political affiliation)
        *   **Platform Usage:**  (e.g., frequency of use, topics followed, creators followed)
        *   **Misinformation Exposure:** (e.g.,  perceived frequency of misinformation exposure, identification of specific examples)
        *   **Misinformation Beliefs and Attitudes:**  (e.g., agreement with specific misinformation claims, trust in different information sources, perceived impact of misinformation)
        *   **Media Literacy:**  (e.g.,  questions assessing the participant's ability to critically evaluate online information)
    *   **Data Analysis:**  Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize survey responses.  Correlation and regression analyses will be used to examine relationships between variables (e.g., the relationship between platform usage, media literacy, and the belief in misinformation).  Qualitative data derived from open-ended questions will be analyzed using thematic analysis.

*   **Literature Review:** A systematic review of existing scholarly literature will be conducted to contextualize the findings. The literature search will cover topics such as social media and political polarization, online disinformation campaigns, media literacy, and the psychological mechanisms underlying belief in misinformation. This will provide the framework for interpreting the results and formulating relevant policy recommendations.
