## 1. Introduction

Drug discovery and materials science are inherently computationally intensive fields.  Designing new drugs and materials requires understanding the complex interactions of atoms and molecules, which are governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. Traditional computational methods, such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Molecular Dynamics (MD), struggle to accurately simulate large and complex systems, imposing significant limitations on the development of new therapeutics and advanced materials. These limitations often arise because classical computers simulate quantum systems by approximating them in ways that sacrifice accuracy or computational efficiency.

Quantum computing, a paradigm shift in computation, promises to overcome these limitations by harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics – superposition and entanglement – to perform computations that are intractable for classical computers. By directly simulating quantum systems, quantum computers offer the potential to accurately model molecular electronic structure, predict protein folding, optimize drug candidates, and design novel materials with unprecedented precision and efficiency.
