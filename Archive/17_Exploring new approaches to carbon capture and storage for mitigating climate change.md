**2. Abstract**

Climate change, driven primarily by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, necessitates urgent and diverse mitigation strategies. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is recognized as a critical technology suite for decarbonizing hard-to-abate industrial sectors and power generation, potentially enabling negative emissions when combined with bioenergy or direct air capture. However, conventional CCS technologies, often relying on amine scrubbing and deep geological storage, face challenges related to high costs, significant energy penalties, long-term storage security concerns, and public acceptance. This paper explores emerging and innovative approaches designed to overcome these limitations. It reviews advancements in capture technologies, including novel solvents and solid sorbents (e.g., MOFs, ILs), advanced membrane systems, chemical looping combustion, Direct Air Capture (DAC), and Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS). Furthermore, it examines innovative storage and utilization pathways beyond traditional geological sequestration, such as enhanced mineral carbonation, sub-seabed storage concepts, and various Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) strategies that convert CO2 into valuable products. The paper synthesizes findings from recent literature, evaluating the technical feasibility, economic viability, environmental implications, and scalability potential of these new approaches. While significant progress is evident, substantial research, development, demonstration, and supportive policy frameworks are crucial to accelerate the deployment of next-generation CCS technologies necessary for achieving ambitious climate targets.

**3. Introduction**

The escalating concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), largely attributed to the combustion of fossil fuels and industrial processes, is the primary driver of global climate change (IPCC, 2021). The Paris Agreement established a global framework to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels. Achieving this ambitious target requires rapid and deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors, alongside strategies for removing existing CO2 from the atmosphere (UNFCCC, 2015).

Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) encompasses a set of technologies designed to capture CO2 emissions from large point sources (like power plants, cement factories, steelworks) or directly from the atmosphere, transport it, and store it securely in geological formations or utilize it in long-lasting products (Global CCS Institute, 2023). Conventional CCS typically involves post-combustion capture using amine-based solvents, followed by compression, pipeline transport, and injection into deep saline aquifers, depleted oil and gas reservoirs, or unmineable coal seams.

While established CCS projects demonstrate technical feasibility, widespread deployment has been hampered by several factors. Key limitations include:
*   **High Costs:** Both capital expenditure (CAPEX) for capture plants and operational expenditure (OPEX), particularly the energy required for solvent regeneration, are significant (Bui et al., 2018).
*   **Energy Penalty:** The capture process itself consumes substantial energy, reducing the net energy output of power plants or increasing the energy intensity of industrial processes.
*   **Storage Security and Monitoring:** Ensuring the long-term permanence of storage and accurately monitoring potential leakage from geological sites remain critical concerns for regulatory approval and public trust.
*   **Infrastructure Requirements:** Large-scale deployment necessitates extensive transport infrastructure (pipelines, ships) connecting capture sites to storage locations.
*   **Public Perception:** Concerns about safety, environmental impact, and the perception of CCS enabling continued fossil fuel use affect social acceptance.

Recognizing these challenges, significant research and development efforts are now focused on innovative and next-generation CCS approaches. These new methodologies aim to reduce costs, improve energy efficiency, enhance storage permanence, broaden applicability (including capturing diffuse atmospheric CO2), and create value through utilization pathways (CCUS). This paper provides a comprehensive overview of these emerging frontiers in CCS, assessing their potential contribution to climate change mitigation.

**4. Methodology**

This research paper employs a comprehensive literature review methodology to explore new approaches in Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). The review synthesizes findings from peer-reviewed scientific journals, conference proceedings, technical reports from reputable international organizations (e.g., International Energy Agency (IEA), Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Global CCS Institute), and government research agencies published primarily within the last decade (approx. 2014-2024) to ensure relevance and focus on recent advancements.

**Search Strategy:** Systematic searches were conducted using major academic databases, including Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and specific energy/environmental science repositories. Keywords and search strings included combinations of: "carbon capture," "carbon storage," "CCS," "CCUS," "novel sorbents," "metal-organic frameworks," "ionic liquids," "membrane separation," "direct air capture," "DAC," "bioenergy with CCS," "BECCS," "chemical looping combustion," "mineral carbonation," "CO2 utilization," "geological storage," "sub-seabed storage," "enhanced CO2 storage," "next-generation CCS," and "climate change mitigation."

**Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria:** Studies were included if they focused on the technical aspects, performance evaluation, economic analysis, or environmental assessment of CCS technologies considered 'new' or 'emerging' compared to conventional amine scrubbing and standard geological storage. Papers discussing significant improvements to existing technologies were also considered. Studies focusing purely on policy, market mechanisms, or social acceptance without technical detail on novel approaches were generally excluded, as were studies on technologies deemed mature with no significant recent innovation.

**Analysis and Synthesis:** Information extracted from the selected literature was categorized based on the stage of the CCS chain (capture, transport, storage/utilization) and the specific technology type. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as capture efficiency, energy penalty, cost estimates (e.g., $/tonne CO2 captured/avoided), technology readiness level (TRL), storage capacity, permanence, and environmental impacts were identified where available. The findings were then synthesized thematically to present a coherent overview of advancements, challenges, and future prospects for each category of emerging CCS technology. The analysis involved comparing different approaches based on these KPIs and assessing their potential role within the broader climate mitigation portfolio.

**5. Results**

The literature review reveals significant advancements across the CCS value chain, focusing on enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, and expanding the scope of CO2 management. Key findings are categorized below:

**5.1. Novel Carbon Capture Technologies**

*   **Advanced Solvents and Solid Sorbents:**
    *   *Non-aqueous Solvents & Phase-Change Solvents:* Research explores solvents like ionic liquids (ILs) and water-lean solvents that require less energy for regeneration compared to traditional aqueous amines (Zhang et al., 2018). Phase-change solvents precipitate upon CO2 absorption, potentially simplifying separation and reducing regeneration heat duty.
    *   *Solid Sorbents:* Materials like Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs), zeolites, and functionalized porous carbons/silicas offer high CO2 adsorption capacity and selectivity (Sumida et al., 2012; Vilhelmsen et al., 2021). Advantages include potentially lower regeneration energy (using temperature, pressure, or vacuum swings) and reduced corrosion issues compared to liquid amines. Challenges remain in material stability, cost-effective synthesis, and performance under realistic flue gas conditions (e.g., presence of water, SOx, NOx).
*   **Advanced Membrane Separation:**
    *   Membrane technology offers a potentially less energy-intensive alternative to solvent scrubbing, with a smaller footprint and modularity. Advancements include highly selective polymeric membranes, inorganic membranes (zeolitic, ceramic, metallic), and mixed-matrix membranes combining polymers with porous fillers (e.g., MOFs) (Ramirez-Santos et al., 2018). Key challenges involve overcoming the trade-off between permeability and selectivity (Robeson limit), maintaining performance under industrial conditions, membrane fouling, and cost reduction.
*   **Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) and Reforming (CLR):**
    *   CLC uses oxygen carriers (typically metal oxides) to transfer oxygen from air to fuel, producing a concentrated stream of CO2 and H2O after combustion, thus avoiding the need for post-combustion separation (Adánez et al., 2018). CLR applies similar principles to produce hydrogen and a pure CO2 stream. While promising for inherent CO2 capture, challenges include oxygen carrier development (stability, reactivity, cost), reactor design complexity, and solids handling.
*   **Direct Air Capture (DAC):**
    *   DAC technologies aim to capture CO2 directly from the ambient air, where its concentration is very low (~420 ppm). Two main approaches dominate:
        *   *Solid DAC (S-DAC):* Uses solid adsorbent materials similar to those in point-source capture but optimized for low CO2 partial pressures, typically regenerated via temperature-vacuum swings (Fasihi et al., 2019).
        *   *Liquid DAC (L-DAC):* Uses aqueous alkaline solutions (e.g., potassium hydroxide) to capture CO2, followed by a chemical process (e.g., calcium caustic loop) to regenerate the solvent and release concentrated CO2 (Keith et al., 2018).
    *   DAC faces significant cost and energy challenges due to the thermodynamics of capturing dilute CO2. However, it is unique in its ability to address legacy emissions and emissions from diffuse sources (e.g., transportation). Scalability and land/water footprint are key considerations.
*   **Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS):**
    *   BECCS combines bioenergy production (from biomass combustion or conversion) with CCS to achieve net-negative CO2 emissions, as the captured CO2 originated from atmospheric uptake by biomass (IEA Bioenergy, 2019). Integration can occur with various bioenergy pathways (combustion, gasification, fermentation). Challenges include sustainable biomass sourcing at scale, land-use competition, biodiversity impacts, logistical complexities, and accurately accounting for lifecycle emissions (Fuss et al., 2018).

**5.2. Innovative Storage and Utilization (CCUS) Approaches**

*   **Enhanced Geological Storage:**
    *   Focuses on improving characterization, modeling, monitoring, and risk management for established geological storage options (saline aquifers, depleted reservoirs). This includes developing advanced seismic monitoring techniques, tracers, and predictive models for plume migration and pressure management (Ajayi et al., 2019). Research also explores storage in unconventional formations like basalts, where CO2 can react and mineralize faster.
*   **Mineral Carbonation:**
    *   *Ex-situ Mineralization:* Involves reacting captured CO2 with calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg)-rich minerals (e.g., olivine, serpentine) or industrial wastes (e.g., steel slag, fly ash) under controlled conditions to form stable solid carbonates (Lackner et al., 2012; Sanna et al., 2014). This offers potentially permanent storage with low leakage risk. Major hurdles include the high energy consumption for mineral pre-treatment (grinding), slow reaction kinetics, large material handling requirements, and overall cost-effectiveness.
    *   *In-situ Mineralization:* Involves injecting CO2 into reactive geological formations (e.g., basalts, peridotites) where it reacts naturally to form carbonates (Matter et al., 2016). Projects like CarbFix in Iceland have demonstrated feasibility, but suitable formations are geographically limited.
*   **CO2 Utilization (CCU):**
    *   Focuses on converting captured CO2 into economically valuable products. Key pathways include:
        *   *Chemicals and Fuels:* Synthesis of methanol, urea, polymers, formic acid, or synthetic fuels (e.g., via Fischer-Tropsch or Sabatier reactions using green hydrogen) (Artz et al., 2018). Challenges include high energy input (often requiring significant renewable energy), catalyst development, market scale limitations, and the durability of CO2 storage (fuels release CO2 upon combustion).
        *   *Building Materials:* Using CO2 for concrete curing or producing carbonate aggregates/building blocks (e.g., via mineralization pathways) (Monkman et al., 2019). This pathway potentially offers large-scale and long-term CO2 storage.
        *   *Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR):* While a mature utilization technique, its climate benefit is debated as it facilitates further fossil fuel extraction. Newer research explores CO2-EOR with a primary focus on maximizing concurrent CO2 storage ('storage-led EOR').
    *   The climate benefit of CCU depends heavily on the lifecycle emissions (including energy source used for conversion) and the durability of CO2 sequestration in the end product (Al-Mamoori et al., 2017).
*   **Sub-seabed and Ocean Storage Concepts:**
    *   Research explores injecting CO2 into geological formations beneath the ocean floor, offering vast potential capacity. Other concepts like direct ocean injection or enhanced ocean alkalinity are also debated but face significant environmental concerns and governance challenges (Bach et al., 2019; GESAMP, 2019).

**6. Discussion**

The results highlight a dynamic landscape of innovation in CCS, driven by the need to overcome the limitations of first-generation technologies and expand the role of CCS in climate mitigation.

**Comparative Analysis and Potential Niches:**
*   New solvents and sorbents promise lower energy penalties for point-source capture compared to conventional amines, potentially making CCS more economically viable for industrial facilities and power plants. MOFs and advanced solid sorbents offer modularity favourable for various scales but require further development for long-term stability and cost reduction.
*   Membranes are attractive for specific applications (e.g., pre-combustion capture, natural gas processing) due to their smaller footprint and operational simplicity, though breakthroughs in permeability/selectivity are still needed for widespread post-combustion use.
*   Chemical looping offers inherent CO2 separation, potentially highly efficient, but faces significant engineering challenges for scale-up.
*   DAC stands apart as a crucial technology for atmospheric CO2 removal, essential for addressing residual emissions and achieving net-zero or net-negative targets. Its high cost and energy demand necessitate significant cost reductions (driven by R&D and scale-up) and integration with abundant low-carbon energy sources (IEA, 2022).
*   BECCS offers a pathway to negative emissions but hinges critically on the sustainable and verifiable sourcing of biomass, addressing complex land-use and ecosystem interactions.

**Storage and Utilization Perspectives:**
*   Mineral carbonation provides a compelling option for highly secure, long-term storage, particularly attractive in regions lacking suitable geological formations or where public acceptance of geological storage is low. However, its current energy intensity and cost remain major barriers. Utilizing industrial wastes offers a synergistic approach.
*   CCU pathways are gaining traction, shifting the paradigm from CO2 as waste to CO2 as a resource. While promising for creating economic value, the scale of CO2 utilization currently projected is insufficient to handle the bulk of captured emissions needed for climate targets (Mac Dowell et al., 2017). Furthermore, careful lifecycle assessment is crucial to ensure genuine climate benefits, particularly for fuels which re-release CO2. Utilization in long-lived products like building materials appears more aligned with long-term climate goals.

**Overarching Challenges and Future Directions:**
Despite progress, several cross-cutting challenges persist:
1.  **Cost Reduction:** The primary barrier remains cost. Continued innovation in materials, process integration, and manufacturing scale-up is essential across all technologies.
2.  **Energy Efficiency:** Reducing the energy penalty of capture and conversion processes is critical, requiring both material/process improvements and integration with low-carbon energy sources.
3.  **Scalability and Integration:** Moving technologies from lab/pilot scale to commercial deployment requires significant investment, robust engineering solutions, and integration into existing energy and industrial systems.
4.  **Infrastructure Development:** Large-scale CCS/CCUS requires coordinated development of CO2 transport networks (pipelines, shipping) and storage/utilization hubs.
5.  **Policy and Regulatory Frameworks:** Clear, stable, and supportive policies are needed to de-risk investment, incentivize deployment, ensure robust monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) for storage permanence, and manage long-term liability. Carbon pricing, tax credits (like 45Q in the US), and public procurement can play vital roles.
6.  **Public Engagement and Acceptance:** Building public trust through transparency, robust safety protocols, and clear communication about the role of CCS within a broader climate strategy is indispensable.

Future research should focus on materials discovery and optimization (sorbents, membranes, catalysts), pilot and demonstration projects under real-world conditions, rigorous techno-economic analyses and life cycle assessments, development of standardised MRV protocols for novel storage methods, and exploring synergies between different CCS/CCUS approaches and integration with renewable energy systems.

**7. Conclusion**

Carbon Capture and Storage is an essential component of the portfolio of solutions required to meet global climate change mitigation targets. While conventional CCS technologies provide a foundation, their limitations necessitate the development and deployment of new and innovative approaches. This review highlights significant progress in developing next-generation capture technologies (advanced sorbents, membranes, DAC, BECCS) and storage/utilization pathways (mineralization, CCU) that promise improved efficiency, lower costs, enhanced permanence, and broader applicability.

Emerging technologies like DAC and BECCS offer unique capabilities for achieving net-negative emissions, crucial for stabilizing the climate in the long term. Innovative storage methods like mineral carbonation provide high-security alternatives to geological storage, while CCU pathways offer potential economic incentives, although their climate benefits must be rigorously assessed.

However, translating this potential into large-scale deployment requires overcoming substantial hurdles. Continued and accelerated efforts in research, development, and demonstration are paramount, alongside significant investments and the establishment of enabling policy and regulatory environments. Public acceptance and robust infrastructure planning are also critical success factors.

No single CCS technology represents a silver bullet. A diverse suite of advanced CCS and CCUS approaches, tailored to specific emission sources, regional contexts, and integrated within systemic decarbonization strategies, will be necessary. By fostering innovation and addressing the associated challenges proactively, next-generation CCS can play a vital role in the transition towards a sustainable, net-zero emissions future.
