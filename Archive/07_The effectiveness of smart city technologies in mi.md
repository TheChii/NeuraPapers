**2. Abstract**

Coastal regions are disproportionately vulnerable to the escalating impacts of climate change, including sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and coastal erosion. This research paper investigates the potential of smart city technologies to mitigate these impacts and enhance the resilience of coastal communities. By integrating data-driven infrastructure, real-time monitoring, and adaptive management strategies, smart cities can potentially optimize resource allocation, improve disaster preparedness, and foster sustainable development. This study examines various smart city technologies, including smart sensors, intelligent transportation systems, predictive analytics, and green infrastructure solutions, assessing their effectiveness in addressing specific climate-related challenges in coastal areas. A mixed-methods approach, combining literature review, case study analysis, and quantitative data analysis, is employed to evaluate the performance of these technologies in diverse coastal contexts. The findings suggest that while smart city technologies hold significant promise for climate change mitigation and adaptation in coastal regions, their effectiveness is contingent upon factors such as technology adoption rates, data accessibility, governance structures, and community engagement. This research provides insights for policymakers, urban planners, and technology developers to implement sustainable and resilient smart city solutions in vulnerable coastal environments.
