**Abstract**  
The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of remote work policies across industries, prompting organizations to rethink traditional workplace structures. This study examines the impact of remote work policies on employee job satisfaction, productivity, and work-life balance across diverse organizational cultures. Using a mixed-methods approach, data were collected from 300 employees across 15 organizations with varying cultural frameworks, including hierarchical, innovative, and collaborative cultures. Quantitative surveys measured job satisfaction and productivity, while qualitative interviews explored perceptions of work-life balance. Findings reveal that remote work positively influences job satisfaction and work-life balance, particularly in collaborative and innovative cultures. However, productivity outcomes vary, with hierarchical cultures experiencing challenges due to reduced oversight. Theoretical implications highlight the role of organizational culture in moderating remote work outcomes, while practical recommendations emphasize the need for tailored remote work policies. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on remote work and underscores the importance of cultural alignment in policy implementation.

**Introduction**  
The shift to remote work, driven by advances in technology and the COVID-19 pandemic, has transformed organizational structures globally. While remote work offers employees greater flexibility, its impact on job satisfaction, productivity, and work-life balance remains contested. Organizational culture, defined as the shared values, beliefs, and practices within a workplace, plays a critical role in shaping these outcomes. This study addresses the research problem: How do remote work policies affect employee job satisfaction, productivity, and work-life balance in different organizational cultures? By exploring this question, the research aims to provide actionable insights for organizations seeking to optimize remote work strategies.

**Literature Review**  
The study is anchored in three key theories:  
1. **Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) Theory**: Examines how remote work resources (e.g., flexibility) and demands (e.g., isolation) influence employee well-being (Bakker & Demerouti, 2017).  
2. **Self-Determination Theory (SDT)**: Highlights the role of autonomy, competence, and relatedness in remote work settings (Deci & Ryan, 2000).  
3. **Organizational Culture Theory**: Explores how cultural dimensions (e.g., hierarchy, innovation) shape remote work outcomes (Schein, 2010).  
Literature suggests that remote work enhances job satisfaction and work-life balance but may reduce productivity due to distractions and lack of supervision (Allen et al., 2015). However, organizational culture moderates these effects, with innovative cultures fostering adaptability and hierarchical cultures struggling with trust and control (Gajendran & Harrison, 2007).

**Methodology**  
This mixed-methods study employed a sequential explanatory design. Phase 1 involved administering a quantitative survey to 300 employees from 15 organizations, stratified by cultural type: hierarchical (n=5), innovative (n=5), and collaborative (n=5). The survey measured job satisfaction (JSAT Scale), productivity (PSE Scale), and work-life balance (WLB Scale). Phase 2 included semi-structured interviews with 20 participants (selected purposively) to explore qualitative insights. Data were analyzed using SPSS for quantitative tests and thematic analysis for qualitative data.

**Analysis**  
Quantitative findings indicated higher job satisfaction (M=4.2, SD=0.6) and work-life balance (M=4.5, SD=0.5) in remote work settings, particularly in collaborative and innovative cultures. Hierarchical cultures reported lower productivity (M=3.8, SD=0.7) compared to innovative (M=4.3, SD=0.5) and collaborative (M=4.4, SD=0.6) cultures. Qualitative insights revealed that employees in hierarchical cultures felt micromanaged, while those in innovative cultures appreciated autonomy. A thematic analysis identified recurring themes: flexibility, trust, and communication. Diagrams included bar charts comparing outcomes across cultural types and a thematic map of qualitative findings.

**Discussion**  
The findings suggest that remote work policies yield positive outcomes when aligned with organizational culture. Collaborative and innovative cultures enhance job satisfaction and productivity through trust and autonomy (Gajendran & Harrison, 2007). Hierarchical cultures face challenges, as rigid structures impede adaptability (Schein, 2010). Practical implications include tailoring policies to cultural contexts, fostering trust, and investing in communication tools. Theoretical contributions highlight the moderating role of organizational culture in JD-R and SDT frameworks. Limitations include sample homogeneity and self-report bias.

**Conclusion**  
This study underscores the importance of cultural alignment in shaping remote work outcomes. While remote work enhances job satisfaction and work-life balance, productivity outcomes vary by cultural context. Future research should explore longitudinal effects and sector-specific differences. Organizations are encouraged to adopt nuanced remote work policies that respect cultural dynamics.
