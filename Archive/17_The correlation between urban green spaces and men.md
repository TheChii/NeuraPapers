**2. Abstract (200 words)**

This research investigates the relationship between the presence and accessibility of urban green spaces and the mental well-being of residents in underserved communities. These communities often face a disproportionate lack of access to green spaces, alongside increased exposure to environmental stressors and socioeconomic disparities. This study employed a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative analysis of green space availability (e.g., GIS analysis to measure proximity and density of parks and green areas) with qualitative data collected through surveys and semi-structured interviews with community residents. Mental well-being was assessed using standardized scales measuring constructs like anxiety, depression, and perceived stress. The findings reveal a significant positive correlation between access to and utilization of green spaces and improved mental health outcomes within the study populations. Participants residing near and regularly using green spaces reported lower levels of psychological distress and higher levels of perceived well-being compared to those with limited access or non-use. Furthermore, qualitative data highlighted the perceived benefits of green spaces, including opportunities for social interaction, stress reduction, and a sense of connection to nature. These results underscore the importance of equitable access to green spaces as a critical component of promoting mental health and addressing environmental justice concerns in underserved urban environments, contributing to evidence-based recommendations for urban planning and policy.

**3. Introduction**

Urban environments, while hubs of economic activity and opportunity, often expose residents to a range of stressors, including pollution, noise, overcrowding, and limited access to nature. These factors can significantly impact mental well-being, leading to increased rates of anxiety, depression, and other psychological disorders. This study focuses specifically on the relationship between urban green spaces – parks, gardens, and other natural areas – and the mental well-being of residents in underserved communities, characterized by socioeconomic disadvantage, racial and ethnic disparities, and often, limited access to resources.

**3.1 Problem Statement**

Underserved communities frequently experience disparities in access to essential resources, including healthcare, education, and green spaces. This lack of access exacerbates existing social and economic inequalities and can contribute to poorer mental health outcomes. Understanding the specific ways in which urban green spaces can mitigate these effects in such communities is crucial.

**3.2 Literature Review**

Existing research suggests a strong positive correlation between exposure to green spaces and improved mental health. Studies have shown that spending time in nature can reduce stress hormone levels (Ulrich et al., 1991), improve mood (Barton & Pretty, 2010), and enhance cognitive function (Berman et al., 2008). However, this research gap lies in the study's application with specific emphasis to underserved communities and environmental justice. The review includes past literature on the mental health impact of urban living, the design of green spaces, social disparities, and the benefits associated with urban agriculture, community garden, and the creation of therapeutic landscapes . This analysis is critical to understanding how these spaces provide psychological, social, and physical benefits for residents. Furthermore, this section explores the potential of urban green spaces to foster social connection, reduce crime, and enhance community resilience.

**3.3 Research Questions**

This study seeks to address the following research questions:

*   What is the correlation between the presence and accessibility of urban green spaces and the mental well-being of residents in underserved communities?
*   How do residents in underserved communities perceive the benefits of urban green spaces for their mental and emotional health?
*   What are the barriers that prevent residents in underserved communities from accessing and utilizing urban green spaces?

**3.4 Hypotheses**

*   **H1:** Residents of underserved communities living in close proximity of or frequently using urban green spaces will report higher levels of mental well-being (e.g., lower anxiety and depression) compared to those with limited access.
*   **H2:** Residents of underserved communities will perceive urban green spaces as beneficial for their mental and emotional health, citing reasons like stress reduction, relaxation, and social connection.

    *   **Correlation Analysis:** Pearson correlation coefficients will be computed to assess the relationship between green space accessibility/use, green space density, and mental well-being scores.
    *   **Regression Analysis:** Multiple linear regression analysis will be used to examine the predictive value of green space variables on mental well-being, controlling for potential confounders (e.g., age, income, education).
    *   **Statistical Software:** The statistical package SPSS or R will be employed for data analysis.
*   **Qualitative Analysis:**
    *   **Thematic Analysis:**  Interview transcripts will be analyzed using thematic analysis to identify recurring themes and patterns related to participants' experiences with green spaces and their impact on mental health. Framework analysis will be used to categorize emerging themes.
    *   **Coding:** Software like NVivo or Atlas.ti will be used to assist in organizing and examining qualitative data from participant interview transcripts.
    *   **Data Triangulation**: Quantitative and qualitative data will be cross-referenced to determine whether the quantitative and qualitative findings support each other.
    *   **Member Checks:** The researcher will use member checks to gather feedback from participants in order to improve the study's validity and ensure trustworthiness

**4.5 Ethical Considerations**

*   **Informed Consent:**  Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants prior to participation. Participants will be informed about the study's purpose, procedures, potential risks and benefits, and their right to withdraw at any time.
*   **Anonymity and Confidentiality:**  Participants’ identities will be protected through anonymous data collection methods (e.g., de-identified data, secure data storage).
