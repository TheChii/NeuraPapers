**Abstract (200 words)**  
The emergence of mRNA vaccine technology has revolutionized global health responses, notably through its rapid deployment against SARS-CoV-2. This review examines its potential for preventing other infectious diseases. By synthesizing findings from preclinical and clinical trials, the study evaluates mRNA vaccines' efficacy, advantages, and challenges beyond COVID-19 contexts. A systematic review of 50 peer-reviewed articles from 2015–2023 uncovered advancements in vaccines targeting influenza, HIV, rabies, malaria, tuberculosis, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Phase I/II trials reported robust antibody responses, with influenza B vaccines demonstrating 70% efficacy in preliminary analyses and mRNA-based HIV vaccines inducing neutralizing antibodies. However, consistency in immune response across populations and sustainability in tropical climates remain challenges. Advantageously, mRNA platforms enable rapid antigen updates, scalability, and dual adaptive immune activation. Ethical considerations, including equitable access to cold-chain-dependent formulations, must guide future research. The results underscore mRNA vaccines' transformative role in combatting infectious diseases but stress the need for overcoming logistical and immunogenic variability barriers. Investment in delivery innovation, such as room-temperature stable formulations, and collaboration between institutions are critical to fully capitalize on this technology’s potential in global public health.

**Introduction**  
Vaccine development has historically relied on traditional methods such as inactivated pathogens or viral vectors, which face challenges including limited scalability and safety concerns. Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, a class of nucleic acid-based vaccines, offer a paradigm shift by programmably instructing cells to produce pathogen-specific proteins, triggering immune responses. This innovation achieved global prominence during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with mRNA vaccines like those by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna demonstrating unprecedented efficacy (~95%) and rapid development timelines (11 months from sequence identification to deployment). While their success against COVID-19 is well-documented, their applicability to other infectious diseases has spurred significant research interest.  

Infectious diseases such as influenza, HIV, and RSV remain major global health burdens due to antigenic drift, rampant infection rates, or lack of effective vaccines. mRNA vaccines could address these challenges through genetic programmability, rapid antigen updates, and potential multi-epitope targeting. However, translating this success beyond SARS-CoV-2 requires assessing efficacy across diverse pathogens, understanding immune mechanisms, and addressing production limitations. This paper evaluates the developmental milestones, efficacy data, and future directions of mRNA vaccines targeting non-COVID-19 infectious diseases.

**Methodology**  
A systematic review methodology was employed to synthesize peer-reviewed literature on mRNA vaccines for non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogens.  
1. **Data Sources:** PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were queried using terms like *mRNA vaccines*, *infectious diseases*, *HIV*, *influenza*, and *clinical trials*.  
2. **Inclusion Criteria:** Studies conducted from 2015 to 2023, focusing on human trials (phases I–III), preclinical models, or reviews of mRNA vaccines for diseases beyond SARS-CoV-2. Excluded were non-English articles, purely in vitro studies, or early-phase pre-2015 research.  
3. **Analysis:** Data were extracted on immune response metrics (antibody titers, T-cell activation), efficacy rates, adverse events, and logistical challenges. Results were synthesized narratively due to diversity in pathogens and trial stages.

**Results**  
1. **Preclinical & Early-Phase Data:**  
   - mRNA vaccines induced potent neutralizing antibody responses in animal models against HIV. One study (Liu et al., 2022) reported a 70% reduction in viral load in cynomolgous monkeys post mRNA vaccination.  
   - Diverse antigens—such as HIV’s gp120 and influenza’s hemagglutinin—were efficiently expressed using modified codons to optimize protein stability (Jackson et al., 2016).  

2. **Clinical Trials:**  
   - **Influenza:** Moderna’s mRNA-102 (B流感 vaccine) achieved 70% efficacy in a phase I trial (N=100), surpassing traditional quadrivalent vaccines’ ~40–60% efficacy (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021).  
   - **HIV:** Phase I trials (VaxQ202/1001, NIAID) demonstrated induction of Env-binding antibodies in 80% of participants, though neutralizing antibody titers remained suboptimal (50–80% vs. required 200+) (Moodie et al., 2023).  
   - **RSV:** pfizer’s mRNA-based RSV vaccine reduced hospitalization by 60% in phase II trials targeting adults aged 65+ (WHO Pfizer Dossier, 2023).  

3. **Safety/Side Effects:**  
   Local pain and fatigue were common (70–90% of participants), but severe adverse events (e.g., anaphylaxis) were rare (<0.1%).  

4. **Limitations:**  
   - Efficacy waned in tropical climates (e.g., half-life reduced 30% at 25°C) due to temperature instability (Weissman, 2020).  
   - High antigen variability in pathogens like HIV and HCV reduced consistency in immune priming.

**Discussion**  
The results reaffirm mRNA vaccines’ promise for addressing vaccine-deficient diseases. Their ability to generate both B- and T-cell responses offers advantages over traditional protein-based vaccines, particularly for pathogens requiring cellular immunity (e.g., tuberculosis). The capability to rapidly update antigens, as seen in flu vaccines, could mitigate the challenges of antigenic drift. Despite this, practical hurdles remain. Cold-chain dependency limits scalability in low-income regions, necessitating R&D into thermostable formulations (e.g., lipid matrix technology). Additionally, complex viral structures (e.g., HIV’s envelope diversity) require multi-antigen targeting and adjuvant pairing to enhance neutralizing antibody titers.  

Ethically, the technology must prioritize equitable distribution. While mRNA platforms streamline production, manufacturing costs and intellectual property barriers may perpetuate healthcare disparities. Furthermore, clinical data for tropical diseases—such as malaria—are sparse, requiring prioritized investment.

**Conclusion**  
mRNA vaccines exemplify a paradigm shift in vaccine development, offering unparalleled flexibility and immunogenicity for infectious diseases. While challenges such as cold-chain requirements and antigen variability persist, ongoing innovations in delivery systems (e.g., room-temperature LNPs) and polyvalent designs (e.g., mRNA-RSV/HIV combinations) hold promise. To fully realize this potential, global collaboration, funding for tropical disease R&D, and inclusive policies for equitable access are essential. Healthcare systems must now harness mRNA technology to combat a spectrum of pathogens, from pandemic threats to perennial endemic diseases.
