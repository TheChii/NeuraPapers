**2. Abstract (200 words)**

Software testing is a critical yet often time-consuming and resource-intensive phase of the software development lifecycle.  This research explores the transformative potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in automating and enhancing various aspects of software testing processes. We investigate how Generative AI models can be leveraged to automate test case generation, detect and repair software bugs, optimize test execution strategies, and improve overall testing efficiency. Our methodology includes a literature review examining existing approaches, a theoretical framework for applying Generative AI models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), to common testing tasks and case studies or hypothetical scenarios demonstrating the application of these techniques.  The research evaluates the gains in automation accuracy, the time and resources saved, and the improved software quality achievable through Generative AI-driven testing. The results indicate the substantial potential for Generative AI to reduce manual effort, prioritize testing efforts based on risk, and accelerate software release cycles. This paper concludes with a discussion of the practical challenges, limitations, and ethical considerations associated with employing Generative AI in software testing, suggesting future research directions for further development and wider adoption within the software engineering domain.

This research explores the following facets:

*   **Automated Test Case Generation:**  Utilizing Generative AI to create a diverse and comprehensive set of test cases, reducing the reliance on manual test case design.
*   **Bug Detection and Repair:** Leveraging Generative AI to identify potential software defects, predict failure scenarios, and even automate the process of bug fixing.
*   **Test Execution and Optimization:** Streamlining the process of test execution by prioritizing tests, dynamically adjusting test strategies, and accelerating the overall testing cycle.
*   **Performance Testing and Scalability:** Examining how AI can assist in stress and load testing to simulate real-world user behaviors and system performance.
