# Abstract  
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive cognitive and motor decline, respectively, with limited treatment options. Recent research suggests a link between the gut microbiome—the community of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract—and these diseases. This paper investigates the microbiome’s potential role in neurodegeneration, exploring mechanisms such as microbial metabolite production, neuroinflammation, and vagus nerve signaling. A systematic review of 20 human studies and 30 animal trials was conducted, focusing on microbiome diversity, specific bacterial taxa, and interventions like probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Results indicate that individuals with AD and PD exhibit altered microbiota diversity, with increased Proteobacteria and reduced Lachnospiraceae genera in PD patients. AD patients showed higher Bacteroides-Prevotella ratios and reduced short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing species, which may contribute to amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation. In experimental models, germ-free mice given microbiota from PD patients exhibited motor deficits, while probiotic supplementation improved cognitive function in AD models. While promising, these findings remain correlative, necessitating causal studies. Implications include the microbiome as a potential therapeutic target via diet, probiotics, or FMT. Further longitudinal human trials are critical to validate these mechanisms.

# Introduction  
Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), exact a significant toll on human health and economies. Despite extensive research, the etiology of these conditions remains incompletely understood, and treatments remain limited. Emerging evidence suggests the gut microbiome may play a modulatory role in central nervous system (CNS) function through the gut-brain axis. This axis involves bidirectional communication via neural pathways (e.g., vagus nerve), immune signaling, and microbial metabolites such as SCFAs and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (Pascal et al., 2017).  

The gut microbiome is implicated in both health and disease. For instance, SCFAs like butyrate support gut barrier integrity and exert anti-inflammatory effects on microglia (Mazzawi et al., 2019). Conversely, dysbiosis—microbial imbalance—may trigger systemic inflammation, contributing to neuroinflammation observed in AD and PD. While AD and PD are classically defined by hallmark proteins—Aβ plaques and tau tangles in AD, α-synuclein Lewy bodies in PD—recent studies highlight a shared pathophysiological basis of gut dysfunction, leaky gut, and systemic immune dysregulation.  

This study investigates whether microbiome changes precede or contribute to disease progression, and evaluates interventions targeting microbiota as potential therapies.

# Methodology  
### **Literature Review**  
A systematic review was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library databases. Keywords included “gut microbiome AND Alzheimer’s,” “Parkinson’s AND enteric nervous system,” and “probiotics AND neuroinflammation.” Inclusion criteria were studies published between 2010 and 2023 investigating microbiota in human cohorts or animal models of AD/PD.  

### **Animal Studies**  
Experimental models included:  
1. **Germ-free mice:** Transplanted with microbiota from either healthy or AD/PD donors to assess cross-colonization effects.  
2. **Antibiotic-treated rodents:** To manipulate microbiome composition and observe behavioral or neuropathological outcomes.  
3. **Probiotic trials:** Testing *Lactobacillus* or *Bifidobacterium* supplements on cognitive/motor performance and Aβ/α-synuclein levels.  

### **Human Investigations**  
Longitudinal cohort studies tracked microbiome changes in preclinical AD (e.g., cognitively normal individuals with early Aβ accumulation) and early PD stages. 16S rRNA sequencing and metagenomics discerned microbial diversity and functional pathways.  

### **Data Analysis**  
Microbiota composition was compared between disease groups and controls. Meta-analyses were performed for probiotic/FMT efficacy, and linear mixed-effects models assessed interaction effects of age and diet on microbiome variability.

# Results  
### **Microbiome Changes in Neurodegenerative Diseases**  
- **AD Patients:** Significant reduction in SCFA producers (*Faecalibacterium prausnitzii* and *Bifidobacterium*) and overrepresentation of Enterobacteriaceae (Lam et al., 2020).  
- **PD Patients:** Increased *Proteobacteria* (e.g., Klebsiella) correlated with disease severity, while decreased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratios were observed (Vogt et al., 2017).  

### **Animal Models**  
- **Germ-free mice transplanted with AD microbiota** showed higher Aβ deposition, potentially via amyloidogenic pathways (Shaik et al., 2018).  
- PD microbiota-colonized mice developed motor dysfunction and α-synuclein aggregates, reversed with vancomycin treatment.  

### **Intervention Outcomes**  
- **Probiotics:** *Lactobacillus* supplementation in AD models reduced neuroinflammation (TNF-α, IL-6) and slowed cognitive decline.  
- **FMT:** Transferring PD microbiota to germ-free mice induced motor deficits, suggesting a microbiome-mediated central pathway (Sampson et al., 2016).

# Discussion  
The results highlight significant microbiome differences in AD and PD, with dysbiosis preceding symptom onset in some cases. Mechanisms may include:  
1. **Metabolic Imbalance:** Reduced SCFA production impairs gut barrier integrity, allowing neurotoxic substances like LPS to enter systemic circulation.  
2. **Neuroinflammation:** Pro-inflammatory taxa (e.g., *Klebsiella*) exacerbate microglial activation, perpetuating neurodegeneration.  
3. **Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Gut-derived serotonin (5-HT) contributes to CNS homeostasis; dysbiosis may reduce peripheral 5-HT, worsening motor function in PD.  

However, correlation does not confirm causation. Further studies are needed to disentangle drivers and consequences of microbiome changes. Challenges include the heterogeneity of human microbiota and environmental confounders like diet.  

### **Limitations**  
- Cross-sectional human studies limit temporal inference.  
- Animal models may not fully capture human disease complexity.

# Conclusion  
The gut microbiome holds promise as a modifiable target in neurodegenerative diseases. Interventions aimed at restoring microbial balance, such as probiotics or FMT, may slow disease progression. Future efforts should prioritize longitudinal cohort studies and controlled clinical trials to establish causal relationships and optimize precision medicine approaches.
