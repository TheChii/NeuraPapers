We explore various capture methods, including pre-combustion, post-combustion, and oxy-fuel combustion, alongside emerging innovations such as direct air capture. The methodological approach encompasses a literature review of peer-reviewed publications, patents, and industry reports, analyzing technological advancements, economic considerations, and environmental impacts. Results highlight the progress made in adsorbent materials, solvents, membranes, and storage site characterization. We discuss the critical challenges that remain, including high costs, energy penalties, and the need for effective regulatory frameworks. The discussion evaluates the sustainability and scalability of different CCS technologies, considering factors such as energy efficiency, CO2 purity, and geological storage capacity. Finally, the paper emphasizes the importance of integrated CCS solutions, combining innovative capture techniques with secure and permanent storage, to achieve deep decarbonization across diverse industrial sectors.

## 3. Introduction

The accumulation of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2), in the atmosphere is the leading driver of global climate change. To limit global warming to the targets set by the Paris Agreement (e.g., well below 2Â°C above pre-industrial levels), drastic reductions in anthropogenic CO2 emissions are essential. While transitioning to renewable energy sources, enhancing energy efficiency, and implementing sustainable land management practices are crucial, they may not be sufficient to achieve the required decarbonization levels within the necessary timeframe. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) emerges as a critical, albeit complex, technology to complement these efforts. CCS involves capturing CO2 from emission sources, transporting it, and safely storing it underground, preventing its release into the atmosphere. This approach offers a means to address emissions from industrial processes (e.g., cement, steel, and chemical production) and power plants that may be difficult or expensive to electrify directly.

This paper delves into the development of sustainable and scalable CCS technologies. We begin by outlining the different CO2 capture methods, including post-combustion capture (e.g., using amine-based solvents), pre-combustion capture (e.g., integrated gasification combined cycle), and oxy-fuel combustion. Furthermore, we explore the advancement of novel capture technologies such as direct air capture (DAC), which removes CO2 directly from the ambient air. The paper explores the current status of these technologies, addressing their advantages, disadvantages, and associated challenges, particularly related to energy efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and the scalability of implementation. The research paper also analyzes the different storage methods, focusing on geological storage in deep saline aquifers, depleted oil and gas reservoirs, and mineral carbonation, evaluating their capacity and security. We critically analyze the economic, environmental, technical, and regulatory aspects of CCS deployments, aiming to identify pathways for developing practical and sustainable CCS systems. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the CCS landscape, setting the stage for future research and development in the field of technology and deployment.
