**2. Abstract**

Urban areas are increasingly vulnerable to the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, characterized by significantly higher temperatures compared to surrounding rural areas. This phenomenon is dangerously amplified during Extreme Weather Events (EWEs), particularly heatwaves, posing severe risks to public health, infrastructure, and energy consumption. Urban Green Spaces (UGS) – including parks, street trees, green roofs, and vertical gardens – are recognized as a key nature-based solution for UHI mitigation. This paper synthesizes current research on the role and effectiveness of UGS in reducing urban temperatures, specifically during EWEs. It reviews the primary mechanisms through which UGS provide cooling, namely evapotranspiration and shading, and examines factors influencing their performance, such as UGS type, size, configuration, species composition, and water availability. The analysis highlights that while the absolute cooling potential of UGS might be constrained by factors like drought stress during prolonged heatwaves, their relative importance as thermal refuges increases significantly under extreme conditions. The paper discusses the implications for urban planning and design, emphasizing the need for strategic integration, management, and maintenance of diverse UGS to enhance urban resilience against climate change and extreme heat. Future research directions are suggested to address knowledge gaps, particularly regarding UGS performance under combined stress conditions.

**3. Introduction**

The 21st century is characterized by rapid urbanization and the escalating impacts of climate change. Over half the global population now resides in cities (United Nations, 2019), which are increasingly experiencing environmental challenges. Among the most significant is the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, a phenomenon where urban areas exhibit higher atmospheric and surface temperatures than their adjacent rural surroundings (Oke, 1982). This temperature disparity arises from factors inherent to urban environments: the prevalence of low-albedo, high-thermal-capacity materials (asphalt, concrete), complex urban geometry trapping radiation, anthropogenic heat release from buildings and transportation, and a relative lack of vegetation and water bodies (Arnfield, 2003).

The UHI effect is not merely a matter of thermal discomfort; it exacerbates air pollution, increases energy demand for cooling, impacts water quality, and poses significant risks to human health, particularly for vulnerable populations like the elderly, children, and those with pre-existing health conditions (Tan et al., 2010; Heaviside et al., 2017). These risks are dramatically amplified during Extreme Weather Events (EWEs), most notably heatwaves, which are projected to increase in frequency, intensity, and duration due to climate change (IPCC, 2021). The synergy between background UHI intensity and superimposed heatwaves creates episodes of extreme urban heat stress, leading to increased morbidity and mortality (Gabriel & Endlicher, 2011).

In response to these challenges, cities are increasingly exploring nature-based solutions to build resilience. Urban Green Spaces (UGS) – encompassing a range of vegetated areas from large parks and urban forests to street trees, green roofs, green walls, and private gardens – have emerged as a promising strategy for mitigating the UHI effect (Bowler et al., 2010; Ziter et al., 2019). UGS counteract UHI drivers through mechanisms like shading, which reduces surface absorption of solar radiation, and evapotranspiration (ET), the combined process of evaporation from soil and transpiration from plants, which converts sensible heat into latent heat, thereby cooling the surrounding air (Konijnendijk et al., 2005; Coutts et al., 2013).

While the general cooling benefits of UGS are well-documented, their specific role and effectiveness *during* EWEs warrant closer examination. Extreme heat and potential accompanying drought conditions can impact vegetation health and physiological functioning, potentially altering the magnitude of cooling services provided (Livesley et al., 2016). Understanding these dynamics is crucial for designing effective urban greening strategies that can reliably function under the most critical conditions.

This research paper aims to synthesize the current state of knowledge on the role of UGS in mitigating the UHI effect specifically during extreme weather events, primarily focusing on heatwaves. It will review the mechanisms of UGS cooling, assess their effectiveness under extreme conditions, discuss influencing factors, and explore implications for resilient urban planning and design. The paper follows a structure encompassing methodology, results, discussion, and conclusion, supported by relevant scientific literature.

**4. Methodology**

This research paper employs a comprehensive literature review and synthesis methodology. The approach focuses on systematically identifying, evaluating, and integrating findings from peer-reviewed scientific literature relevant to the role of Urban Green Spaces (UGS) in mitigating the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, with a specific emphasis on performance during Extreme Weather Events (EWEs), particularly heatwaves.

**Search Strategy:**
A systematic search was conducted across major academic databases, including Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect. Search terms included combinations of keywords such as: "Urban Heat Island," "UHI," "Urban Green Space," "UGS," "green infrastructure," "parks," "street trees," "green roofs," "urban vegetation," "mitigation," "cooling effect," "evapotranspiration," "shading," "extreme weather," "heatwave," "climate change adaptation," and "urban resilience." Boolean operators (AND, OR) were used to refine searches. The search was primarily focused on studies published from the year 2000 onwards to capture the most recent advancements, although foundational earlier works were also included. Reference lists of key articles and review papers were also manually scanned to identify additional relevant studies (snowballing).

**Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria:**
Studies were included if they met the following criteria:
*   Published in peer-reviewed journals or reputable conference proceedings.
*   Explicitly addressed the relationship between UGS and UHI mitigation.
*   Provided empirical data (field measurements, remote sensing) or modelling results on the cooling effects of UGS.
*   Included analysis or discussion relevant to UGS performance during high-temperature periods, heatwaves, or simulated extreme conditions.
*   Focused on urban or peri-urban environments.

Studies were excluded if they:
*   Focused solely on non-thermal ecosystem services of UGS (e.g., biodiversity, recreation) without linking to UHI.
*   Lacked quantitative or qualitative analysis of cooling effects.
*   Were purely review articles without novel synthesis relevant to the specific focus on EWEs (though reviews were used to identify primary sources).
*   Dealt exclusively with rural or non-urban contexts.

**Data Synthesis and Analysis:**
Relevant information was extracted from the selected studies, focusing on:
*   Mechanisms of UGS cooling (shading, ET).
*   Quantified cooling effects (e.g., temperature differences in °C for surface and air temperature).
*   Types of UGS studied (parks, trees, green roofs, etc.).
*   Factors influencing cooling performance (size, shape, species, water status, urban morphology, meteorological conditions).
*   Specific findings related to performance during heatwaves or drought conditions.
*   Methodological approaches used (field measurements, remote sensing, numerical modelling).

The extracted information was synthesized thematically. Patterns, consistencies, and contradictions across studies were identified. The analysis focused on synthesizing the evidence regarding the effectiveness and limitations of UGS cooling during EWEs and identifying key implications for urban planning and management. The synthesis forms the basis for the Results and Discussion sections.

**5. Results**

The literature review reveals substantial evidence confirming the crucial role of Urban Green Spaces (UGS) in mitigating the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, with significant implications for thermal comfort and resilience during Extreme Weather Events (EWEs). Key findings are summarized below:

**Mechanisms of Cooling:**
Two primary biophysical mechanisms underpin the cooling effect of UGS:

*   **Shading:** Tree canopies and, to a lesser extent, shrubs and green walls, intercept incoming solar radiation, preventing it from reaching and heating underlying surfaces (e.g., pavement, buildings). This significantly reduces surface temperatures, which in turn reduces the heat radiated and convected into the surrounding air (Shashua-Bar & Hoffman, 2000; Lee et al., 2013). The effectiveness of shading depends on canopy density, Leaf Area Index (LAI), tree height and structure, and solar angle. Studies consistently show substantial reductions in mean radiant temperature and surface temperature under tree canopies, often exceeding 10-20°C compared to sun-exposed surfaces, particularly during peak solar radiation periods common in heatwaves (Konarska et al., 2016; Lindberg & Grimmond, 2011).
*   **Evapotranspiration (ET):** Plants absorb water through their roots and release it as water vapor through their leaves (transpiration), while water also evaporates from soil and leaf surfaces. This phase change from liquid water to water vapor consumes energy (latent heat flux), drawing heat from the surrounding air and thus lowering local air temperatures (Bowler et al., 2010; Coutts et al., 2013). The magnitude of ET cooling depends heavily on vegetation type, leaf area, soil moisture availability, solar radiation, air temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Parks and areas with extensive tree cover generally exhibit the strongest ET cooling effect on ambient air temperature (Jaganmohan et al., 2016; Ziter et al., 2019).

**Magnitude and Extent of Cooling:**

*   **Local Cooling:** UGS demonstrably create localized cool spots. Large parks can reduce air temperatures within their boundaries by several degrees Celsius (typically 1-5°C) compared to surrounding built-up areas, especially during daytime and early evening (Cao et al., 2010; Feyisa et al., 2014). Street trees and small green patches also provide localized cooling, particularly impacting pedestrian thermal comfort through shading (Shashua-Bar et al., 2011). Green roofs can reduce surface temperatures significantly and decrease heat flux into buildings, though their impact on ambient air temperature at street level is generally smaller than that of parks or trees (Saadatian et al., 2013).
*   **Cool Island Effect:** Cooling benefits can extend beyond the UGS boundary into adjacent built-up areas, creating a 'park cool island' (PCI) effect. The extent and intensity of this effect depend on park size, shape, vegetation density, surrounding urban morphology, and prevailing wind conditions (Feyisa et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2020).

**Performance During Extreme Weather Events (Heatwaves):**

*   **Continued Effectiveness:** Studies explicitly examining UGS performance during heatwaves confirm that they continue to provide significant cooling benefits relative to non-vegetated areas (Broadbent et al., 2018; Ziter et al., 2019). Shading remains effective as long as foliage is present, offering crucial protection from intense solar radiation during heatwaves.
*   **Importance of ET:** Evapotranspiration plays a vital role in reducing peak air temperatures during heatwaves. However, its effectiveness can be constrained by water availability. During prolonged heatwaves accompanied by drought, soil moisture depletion can lead to stomatal closure in plants, reducing transpiration rates and thus diminishing the ET cooling effect (Rahman et al., 2017; Livesley et al., 2016). Irrigated UGS or species adapted to drought conditions may maintain higher cooling rates under such stress.
*   **Relative Importance Increases:** While the *absolute* magnitude of ET cooling might decrease under drought stress, the *relative* importance of UGS as cool refuges during EWEs increases dramatically. Even reduced cooling provides vital respite when ambient temperatures are dangerously high (Demuzere et al., 2019). Shading benefits, being less dependent on water status, remain particularly crucial.
*   **Nighttime Cooling:** While UGS are most effective during the day, larger green spaces can also contribute to slightly faster cooling rates during the night compared to dense urban cores, although this effect is often less pronounced than daytime cooling (Ramamurthy et al., 2015). This is important as high nighttime temperatures during heatwaves are a major health risk.

**Factors Influencing Effectiveness:**

*   **UGS Characteristics:** Size, percentage of tree cover, vegetation density (LAI, green volume), and connectivity are positively correlated with cooling intensity and extent (Yu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2017). Tree species selection matters, with broadleaf deciduous trees often providing excellent summer shade and higher transpiration rates (when water is available) compared to some conifers or drought-stressed species (Rahman et al., 2020).
*   **Water Availability:** As noted, soil moisture is critical for sustaining ET cooling, particularly during EWEs. Irrigation can boost cooling but raises questions about water resource management (Kuoppamäki et al., 2016).
*   **Urban Context:** The cooling effect is influenced by the surrounding urban fabric (building density, street geometry, presence of other heat sources) and background climate (Demuzere et al., 2019).

**6. Discussion**

The results synthesized from the literature strongly underscore the vital role of Urban Green Spaces (UGS) as a nature-based solution for mitigating the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, particularly during the critical periods of Extreme Weather Events (EWEs) like heatwaves. The dual mechanisms of shading and evapotranspiration provide demonstrable cooling benefits, reducing both surface and air temperatures and enhancing thermal comfort.

**Significance During EWEs:**
The findings highlight that while the absolute performance of UGS, especially the ET component, can be challenged by the extreme conditions themselves (e.g., drought stress reducing transpiration), their *relative* significance skyrockets during heatwaves. In scenarios where urban temperatures reach dangerous thresholds, any degree of cooling offered by UGS provides crucial thermal refuge spaces, potentially reducing heat-related stress, morbidity, and mortality (Heaviside et al., 2017; Ziter et al., 2019). Shading, being less sensitive to water stress than ET, provides a reliable and substantial contribution to daytime cooling under extreme solar radiation loads, directly benefiting pedestrians and reducing heat storage in urban surfaces. Therefore, even under sub-optimal physiological conditions, UGS remain a cornerstone of urban heat resilience strategies.

**Complexity and Influencing Factors:**
The effectiveness of UGS is not uniform; it is highly dependent on a complex interplay of factors. The size and configuration of green spaces matter significantly, with larger, well-vegetated parks generally providing more substantial and far-reaching cooling (Feyisa et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2020). The type of vegetation is also critical. Trees, with their large canopy for shade and high potential transpiration rates, are often the most effective elements for cooling (Rahman et al., 2020). However, the benefits are modulated by species characteristics (e.g., drought tolerance, canopy density) and management practices, particularly irrigation.

The interaction between UGS and water availability during EWEs represents a key challenge and trade-off. Maximizing ET cooling during heatwaves might require irrigation, placing additional demands on potentially scarce water resources (Livesley et al., 2016; Kuoppamäki et al., 2016). This underscores the importance of selecting climate-appropriate and drought-tolerant species, employing water-wise irrigation techniques (where irrigation is feasible and necessary), and potentially exploring integrated water management strategies (e.g., using stormwater or recycled water).

**Implications for Urban Planning and Design:**
The evidence strongly advocates for the strategic integration and expansion of UGS within urban planning frameworks to enhance climate resilience. Key considerations include:

1.  **Strategic Placement:** Prioritize UGS development and enhancement in areas identified as urban heat hotspots or lacking access to cooling resources, particularly in vulnerable neighbourhoods.
2.  **Hierarchy and Connectivity:** A network approach combining large parks (for significant cooling islands), smaller neighbourhood parks, street trees (for shading corridors), green roofs, and walls can maximize cooling benefits across different scales. Connectivity enhances ecological function and potentially facilitates cool air advection.
3.  **Design and Species Selection:** Emphasize tree planting for shade and ET. Select diverse, climate-appropriate species, including drought-tolerant varieties, to ensure functionality during EWEs and minimize water demand. Consider vertical structure and canopy density for optimal shading.
4.  **Management and Maintenance:** Adequate maintenance, including appropriate watering strategies (especially during establishment and EWEs, if resources permit) and soil management, is crucial for maintaining vegetation health and maximizing cooling services.
5.  **Integration with Grey Infrastructure:** Combine green solutions with other UHI mitigation strategies like cool pavements and reflective building materials for synergistic effects.
6.  **Equity:** Ensure equitable distribution and access to high-quality UGS across different socio-economic groups, as vulnerability to extreme heat is often socially stratified (Nesbitt et al., 2019).

**Limitations and Future Research:**
While the benefits are clear, research gaps remain. More studies are needed to:
*   Quantify the long-term performance of different UGS types and species under combined stresses (heat, drought, pollution) typical of future climate scenarios.
*   Better understand the micro-scale and cumulative cooling effects of diverse UGS configurations within complex urban morphologies.
*   Investigate the trade-offs between cooling Covenants and water consumption more thoroughly, especially for different species and irrigation regimes during EWEs.
*   Develop more precise models integrating UGS characteristics, plant physiology under stress, and urban climate dynamics to predict cooling performance during specific EWEs.
*   Assess the cost-effectiveness and socio-economic impacts of large-scale UGS implementation for heat mitigation.

**7. Conclusion**

The Urban Heat Island effect poses a significant and growing threat to urban populations, particularly when amplified by extreme weather events such as heatwaves. This review confirms that Urban Green Spaces are an indispensable tool for mitigating extreme urban heat. Through the primary mechanisms of shading and evapotranspiration, UGS provide substantial cooling benefits, reducing surface and air temperatures and creating vital thermal refuges within the urban landscape.

While the performance of UGS, particularly evapotranspirative cooling, can be influenced by factors like water availability during prolonged heat and drought, their overall importance during EWEs is magnified. They offer essential respite from dangerous heat conditions, contributing significantly to urban resilience and public health protection. The effectiveness of UGS is contingent upon characteristics like size, type, vegetation density, species composition, water status, and the surrounding urban context.

Therefore, proactive and strategic urban planning that prioritizes the creation, preservation, equitable distribution, and sustainable management of diverse and well-maintained UGS is not merely an aesthetic consideration but a critical imperative for adapting cities to climate change. Integrating UGS networks into the urban fabric is a key nature-based solution for building healthier, more comfortable, and resilient cities capable of withstanding the increasing pressures of extreme heat in the 21st century. Further research focusing on UGS performance under combined stress conditions and optimizing design and management strategies will strengthen their role in future urban climate adaptation.
