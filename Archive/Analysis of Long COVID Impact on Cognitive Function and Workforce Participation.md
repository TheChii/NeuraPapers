**Abstract**  
Long COVID, characterized by persistent symptoms following acute COVID-19 infection, has emerged as a significant public health concern. This study investigates the relationship between Long COVID-associated cognitive impairments and workforce participation. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining quantitative cognitive assessments (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Trail Making Test) and self-reported surveys from 500 adults with Long COVID, alongside qualitative interviews with 30 participants. Results indicated that 68% of participants exhibited mild to severe cognitive deficits, with 45% reporting reduced work hours and 22% leaving employment entirely. Cognitive impairments, particularly in memory, attention, and executive function, were strongly correlated with occupational challenges (*r* = 0.52, *p* < 0.01). Qualitative themes highlighted difficulties in multitasking, meeting deadlines, and workplace stigma. These findings underscore the need for workplace accommodations, targeted healthcare interventions, and policy reforms to support affected individuals. Limitations include the cross-sectional design and potential self-report bias. Future longitudinal studies are recommended to explore causal relationships and long-term outcomes.  

**1. Introduction**  
Long COVID, affecting an estimated 10–30% of COVID-19 survivors, manifests with symptoms persisting beyond 12 weeks post-infection. While fatigue and respiratory issues are well-documented, cognitive dysfunction—termed "brain fog"—remains understudied despite its profound impact on daily functioning. Cognitive deficits, including impaired memory, attention, and executive function, threaten workforce participation, exacerbating economic burdens on individuals and societies. This study aims to (1) quantify cognitive impairments in Long COVID patients, (2) assess their workforce participation rates, and (3) explore how cognitive decline influences employment outcomes. By bridging this knowledge gap, the research informs clinical, occupational, and policy interventions.  

**2. Methodology**  
**Design**: Cross-sectional mixed-methods study.  
**Participants**: 500 adults (18–65 years) with Long COVID, recruited via clinics and online platforms. Inclusion criteria: confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, persistent symptoms >12 weeks, and self-reported cognitive complaints. Exclusion: pre-existing neurological conditions.  
**Measures**:  
- *Cognitive Tests*: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Trail Making Test (TMT-A/B).  
- *Surveys*: Demographic data, symptom duration, employment status, and productivity (WHO Health and Work Performance Questionnaire).  
- *Interviews*: Semi-structured discussions with 30 participants on workplace experiences.  
**Analysis**: Quantitative data analyzed via regression models; qualitative data thematically coded. Ethical approval and informed consent obtained.  

**3. Results**  
- **Cognitive Function**: 68% scored below MoCA cutoffs (≤26/30); TMT-B scores indicated executive dysfunction in 55%.  
- **Workforce Impact**: 45% reduced work hours; 22% unemployed. Cognitive scores predicted 34% variance in employment status (*R²* = 0.34, *p* < 0.001).  
- **Qualitative Themes**: Participants reported stigma, reduced job performance, and employer inflexibility.  

**4. Discussion**  
Cognitive deficits in Long COVID patients significantly disrupt workforce engagement, aligning with prior studies (Davis et al., 2021). The correlation between MoCA scores and employment highlights the need for cognitive screening in post-COVID care. Workplace stigma and lack of accommodations exacerbate disparities, urging policy reforms. Limitations include sampling bias and cross-sectional design. Future research should explore longitudinal outcomes and interventions like cognitive rehabilitation.  

**5. Conclusion**  
Long COVID imposes substantial cognitive and occupational burdens, necessitating multidisciplinary strategies. Employers should adopt flexible policies, while healthcare systems must integrate cognitive assessments into post-COVID care. Addressing these challenges is critical to mitigating socioeconomic impacts.
